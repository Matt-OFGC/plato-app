# Unit Conversion and Costing System - Complete Guide

## Overview

This document explains how Plato's unit conversion and costing system works. The system is designed to be **seamless, accurate, and work every time** with any unit combination worldwide.

---

## Core Design Principles

1. **Universal Compatibility**: All units can convert to all other units (within their category)
2. **Accuracy First**: Uses verified conversion factors from official US, UK, and metric standards
3. **Bulletproof Fallback**: If primary calculation fails, robust fallback ensures it still works
4. **Density-Aware**: Intelligently handles weight ↔ volume conversions when density is available
5. **Worldwide Support**: US, UK, Metric, and compound units all work seamlessly

## Supported Units

### Weight Units (convert to grams)
- `g` (grams) - base unit
- `kg` (kilograms) = 1000g
- `oz` (ounces) = 28.3495g
- `lb` (pounds) = 453.592g

### Volume Units - Metric (convert to milliliters)
- `ml` (milliliters) - base unit
- `l` (liters) = 1000ml
- Accepted variations: `litre`, `litres`, `liter`, `liters`

### Volume Units - US Standard (convert to milliliters)
- `fl oz` (fluid ounces) = 29.5735ml
- `cups` (US cups) = 236.588ml
- `tbsp` (tablespoons) = 14.7868ml
- `tsp` (teaspoons) = 4.92892ml
- Accepted variations: `floz`, `fl-oz`, `cup`, `tablespoon`, `teaspoon`

### Volume Units - UK/Imperial (convert to milliliters)
⚠️ **Important**: UK measurements are different from US!
- `uk fl oz` = 28.4131ml (vs US 29.5735ml)
- `uk cup` = 284.131ml (vs US 236.588ml)
- `uk tbsp` = 17.7582ml (vs US 14.7868ml)
- `uk tsp` = 5.91939ml (vs US 4.92892ml)

### Container/Compound Units
- `case`, `cases`
- `box`, `boxes`
- `bottle`, `bottles` (default: 750ml)
- `can`, `cans` (default: 330ml)
- `pack`, `packs`
- `carton`, `cartons`

Can also be specified as compound units: `6x12L`, `12x500ml`, etc.

### Count Units
- `each`
- `slices`
- `piece`, `pieces`

---

## How Compound Units Work

### Format
Compound units allow you to specify complex packaging like "cases of 6 boxes of 12 liters each".

**Supported formats:**
- `6x12L` = 6 × 12 liters = 72 liters
- `12x500ml` = 12 × 500ml = 6 liters
- `24x330ml` = 24 × 330ml = 7.92 liters

### Example
If you buy milk in **"cases of 6 boxes, each box is 12 liters"**:
- Pack Quantity: `1`
- Pack Unit: `6x12L`
- The system automatically calculates: 1 × (6 × 12L) = 72L = 72,000ml

---

## How Cost Calculation Works

### The Process

1. **Find Ingredient**: Match ingredient name (case-insensitive)

2. **Try Primary Function**: `computeIngredientUsageCostWithDensity()`
   - Handles all conversions including density-based cross-conversions
   - If it returns a valid cost (> 0), use it

3. **Fallback to Robust Calculation**:
   ```
   a. Convert recipe quantity to base unit (g, ml, or each)
   b. Convert pack quantity to base unit
   c. If base units match → simple calculation
   d. If base units don't match but have density → cross-conversion
   e. Return cost or 0
   ```

### Example Calculations

#### Volume to Volume (No Density Needed)
**Recipe**: 10 liters of milk  
**Pack**: 8000ml for £5.85  

1. Convert recipe: 10L → 10,000ml
2. Convert pack: 8000ml → 8000ml
3. Cost per ml: £5.85 / 8000 = £0.00073125
4. Total: 10,000ml × £0.00073125 = **£7.31**

#### Weight to Weight (No Density Needed)
**Recipe**: 500g of flour  
**Pack**: 1.5kg for £2.50  

1. Convert recipe: 500g → 500g
2. Convert pack: 1.5kg → 1500g
3. Cost per g: £2.50 / 1500 = £0.00166667
4. Total: 500g × £0.00166667 = **£0.83**

#### Cross-Conversion (Density Required)
**Recipe**: 250ml of olive oil  
**Pack**: 1kg for £8.50  
**Density**: 0.92 g/ml  

1. Convert recipe: 250ml → 250ml
2. Convert pack: 1kg → 1000g
3. Base units don't match (ml vs g) → use density
4. Convert pack to volume: 1000g / 0.92 = 1086.96ml
5. Cost per ml: £8.50 / 1086.96 = £0.00782
6. Total: 250ml × £0.00782 = **£1.95**

#### Compound Units
**Recipe**: 2L of juice  
**Pack**: 1 case (`6x2L`) for £12.00  

1. Convert recipe: 2L → 2000ml
2. Convert pack: `6x2L` → 12L → 12,000ml
3. Cost per ml: £12.00 / 12,000 = £0.001
4. Total: 2000ml × £0.001 = **£2.00**

## Conversion Matrix

### Same-Category Conversions (Always Work)
✅ ml ↔ l ↔ fl oz ↔ cups ↔ tbsp ↔ tsp ↔ uk fl oz  
✅ g ↔ kg ↔ oz ↔ lb  
✅ each ↔ slices ↔ pieces  

### Cross-Category Conversions (Need Density)
⚠️ g ↔ ml (requires density in g/ml)  
⚠️ kg ↔ l (requires density)  
⚠️ oz ↔ fl oz (requires density)  

### Automatic Conversions
🔄 `oz` → `fl oz` when pack is a volume unit (smart detection)  
🔄 All spelling variations normalized (`litre` → `l`, `floz` → `fl oz`)  

---

## Setting Up Ingredients

### For Liquids (Volume-Based)
**Example: Milk**
- Pack Quantity: `8000`
- Pack Unit: `ml` (or `l`, `fl oz`, etc.)
- Density: Leave empty (not needed for volume-to-volume)

**In Recipe**: Use any volume unit (`ml`, `l`, `cups`, `fl oz`, `tbsp`, `tsp`)

### For Solids (Weight-Based)
**Example: Flour**
- Pack Quantity: `1.5`
- Pack Unit: `kg` (or `g`, `lb`, `oz`)
- Density: Leave empty (not needed for weight-to-weight)

**In Recipe**: Use any weight unit (`g`, `kg`, `oz`, `lb`)

### For Density-Based Ingredients
**Example: Olive Oil**
- Pack Quantity: `1`
- Pack Unit: `kg`
- Density: `0.92` (g/ml) - enables cross-conversion

**In Recipe**: Can use EITHER weight OR volume (`g`, `kg`, `ml`, `l`, etc.)

### For Compound Units
**Example: Bulk Milk Cases**
- Pack Quantity: `1`
- Pack Unit: `6x12L` (6 boxes of 12 liters each)
- Price: Cost for 1 case (£45.00)

**In Recipe**: Use any volume unit, it will convert automatically

## Common Density Values

Use these when you want weight ↔ volume conversion:

| Ingredient | Density (g/ml) |
|------------|----------------|
| Water | 1.00 |
| Milk (whole) | 1.03 |
| Milk (skim) | 1.04 |
| Cream | 1.01 |
| Olive oil | 0.92 |
| Vegetable oil | 0.92 |
| Butter (melted) | 0.91 |
| Honey | 1.42 |
| Flour (all-purpose) | 0.53 |
| Sugar (granulated) | 0.85 |
| Brown sugar (packed) | 0.90 |
| Cocoa powder | 0.48 |
| Salt | 1.20 |
| Baking powder | 0.96 |

## Accuracy Guarantees

### Conversion Factors Verified Against:
- **US**: NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
- **UK**: British Imperial System standards
- **Metric**: International System of Units (SI)

### Precision:
- All conversion factors have 4+ decimal places
- Calculations use JavaScript's native `Number` (64-bit float)
- Precision: ~15-17 significant decimal digits

### Error Handling:
1. Invalid units → returns 0 (doesn't crash)
2. Missing data → returns 0 (doesn't crash)
3. Density mismatch → attempts fallback conversion
4. All errors logged to console for debugging

---

## How It Works Internally

### Step 1: Normalize Units
```javascript
'floz' → 'fl oz'
'litre' → 'l'
'cup' → 'cups'
```

### Step 2: Parse Compound Units (if applicable)
```javascript
'6x12L' → { multiplier: 6, baseQuantity: 12, baseUnit: 'l' }
Total: 72L = 72,000ml
```

### Step 3: Convert to Base Units
```javascript
toBase(10, 'l') → { amount: 10000, base: 'ml' }
toBase(500, 'g') → { amount: 500, base: 'g' }
toBase(2, 'cups') → { amount: 473.176, base: 'ml' }
```

### Step 4: Calculate Cost
```javascript
if (recipeBase === packBase) {
  // Simple calculation
  costPerUnit = packPrice / packBaseAmount
  totalCost = recipeBaseAmount * costPerUnit
}
else if (density) {
  // Cross-conversion with density
  // (convert pack to recipe's unit type)
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cost Shows £0.00

**Possible causes:**
1. ❌ Ingredient name doesn't match exactly
   - **Fix**: Check spelling, spaces, capitalization
   
2. ❌ Pack price is 0 or empty
   - **Fix**: Enter pack price
   
3. ❌ Pack quantity is 0 or empty
   - **Fix**: Enter pack quantity

4. ❌ Units are incompatible and no density
   - **Example**: Recipe uses `ml`, pack is `g`, but density is empty
   - **Fix**: Add density or use compatible units

5. ❌ Invalid unit
   - **Fix**: Use supported units from this document

### Wrong Cost Displayed

**Check:**
1. ✓ Pack unit is correct (not confusing `l` with `kg`)
2. ✓ Density is correct (if cross-converting)
3. ✓ Recipe unit matches what you want
4. ✓ US vs UK units (they're different!)

### Conversion Not Working

**Verify:**
1. Units are in the same category OR density is provided
2. Spelling is correct (check variations)
3. Check console for error messages

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Use the simplest unit that matches your packaging
- Add density for ingredients you might use by weight OR volume
- Use compound units for bulk purchases (`6x12L`)
- Check the costing section to verify calculations

### ❌ DON'T:
- Mix up `l` (liter) with `lb` (pound)
- Forget to add density if cross-converting
- Use UK units if your supplier uses US units
- Leave pack price or quantity empty

- Pack Unit: `l`
- Density: `0.92` g/ml (for weight conversion)
- Recipe uses: `250ml` → Cost: €2.25
- Can also use: `230g` → Cost: €2.07 (auto-converts)

### Example 4: Bulk Supplier (Compound)
**Ingredient**: Tomato Sauce
- Buy: 1 case of 6 boxes, each box has 12 liters
- Pack Quantity: `1`
- Pack Unit: `6x12L`
- Price: £85.00 for the case
- Recipe uses: `2L` → Cost: £2.36

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check this document for common solutions
2. Verify your ingredient setup (pack quantity, unit, price)
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Ensure units are compatible or density is provided

The system is built to be resilient and accurate - if it's not working, it's usually a data entry issue rather than a calculation problem.
