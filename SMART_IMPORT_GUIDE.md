## Technical Details

### File Size Limits
- Maximum file size: Determined by browser (typically 100MB+)
- Recommended: Keep under 10MB for best performance
- For very large datasets, consider splitting into multiple files

### Data Processing
- Client-side file parsing for privacy
- Server-side validation and import
- Atomic transactions (all or nothing for each row)
- Duplicate detection by exact name match per company

### Security
- Files are processed in memory
- No permanent storage of uploaded files
- Company-scoped data (you only see your data)
- Rate limiting on import endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to parse file"
- Ensure file is valid CSV or Excel format
- Check that file isn't corrupted
- Try opening in Excel/Sheets first to verify

### "No data provided"
- File might be empty
- First row should contain headers
- Ensure at least one data row exists

### "Invalid unit"
- Check unit spelling
- Use standard abbreviations (g, kg, ml, l, etc.)
- Refer to supported units list above

### "Name is required"
- Every row must have a name
- Name field cannot be empty
- Check your column mapping
