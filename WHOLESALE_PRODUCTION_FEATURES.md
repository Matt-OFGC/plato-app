# Wholesale & Production Planning Features

## Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive system for managing wholesale customers and production planning with flexible yield management.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Flexible Yield Management in Production Planning**
- **Custom Yield Input**: When creating a production plan, you can now specify the **total quantity** you want to make instead of just batches
  - Example: Enter "24 loaves" instead of "2 batches"
  - The system automatically calculates the number of batches needed
  - Displays both total yield and batch count: "24 loaves (2 batches)"
- **Edit Production Plans**: Click the "Edit" button on any production plan to:
  - Add new recipes
  - Remove recipes
  - Adjust quantities up or down
  - Change dates
- **Smart Display**: Production items show both the total output and batch count for clarity

### 2. **Wholesale Customer Management**
- **New Page**: `/dashboard/wholesale` - Manage all your wholesale customers
- **Customer Information**:
  - Business name
  - Contact person
  - Email & phone
  - Full address (street, city, postcode, country)
  - Internal notes
  - Active/Inactive status
- **Visual Dashboard**:
  - Card-based layout showing all customers
  - Quick view of contact details
  - Track number of production items and orders per customer
  - Separate sections for active and inactive customers

### 3. **Database Schema**
Added three new database models:
- **WholesaleCustomer**: Stores customer information
- **WholesaleOrder**: For tracking wholesale orders (foundation for future features)
- **WholesaleOrderItem**: Individual items in wholesale orders

Updated **ProductionItem** model:
- Added optional `customerId` field to track which customer each production item is for
- Added optional `notes` field for item-specific notes

### 4. **API Endpoints**
Created RESTful APIs for wholesale customer management:
- `POST /api/wholesale/customers` - Create new customer
- `GET /api/wholesale/customers` - List all customers
- `PATCH /api/wholesale/customers/[id]` - Update customer
- `DELETE /api/wholesale/customers/[id]` - Delete customer

Updated production plan API:
- `PATCH /api/production/plans/[id]` - Edit existing production plans
- `DELETE /api/production/plans/[id]` - Delete production plans
