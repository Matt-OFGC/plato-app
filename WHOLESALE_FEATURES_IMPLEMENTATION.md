## üîê Security & Configuration

### Environment Variables Needed:
```env
# For cron job authentication
CRON_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Already required (database, email, etc.)
DATABASE_URL=...
```

### Vercel Cron Setup:
The `vercel.json` file configures automatic cron execution. When you deploy to Vercel:
1. Cron will run daily at 2 AM UTC
2. Authenticates with `CRON_SECRET` header
3. Generates any pending recurring orders

### Alternative Cron Setup:
If not using Vercel, you can set up any external cron service to call:
```bash
curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/generate-recurring-orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key"
```
