## üé¨ INTRO VIDEO SCRIPT

**Title:** "Why I Built Plato (And Why I'm Sharing My Food Business Journey)"  
**Length:** 3-4 minutes  
**Format:** Documentary-style, personal, authentic

---

### [OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
**VISUAL:** You in one of your caf√©s, morning light, coffee being made in background

**SCRIPT:**
> "I've costed over 500 recipes in the last five years.
> 
> And I can tell you the exact moment I realized most caf√© owners ‚Äî including myself ‚Äî were doing it completely wrong.
> 
> Let me show you what I mean."

---

### [THE PROBLEM - 0:15-0:45]
**VISUAL:** Cut to you at a laptop/tablet with recipe cards

**SCRIPT:**
> "Hey, I'm Matt Penney. I run The Market Caf√© and Oh, For Goodness Cake here in Shrewsbury.
> 
> Started out baking cakes in a tiny kitchen. Now we're a multi-site caf√© and bakery.
> 
> But here's the thing nobody tells you when you start:
> 
> You can make incredible food... and still go broke.
> 
> Because if you don't know your numbers ‚Äî your REAL costs ‚Äî you're flying blind.
> 
> And I was flying blind for way too long."

---

### [YOUR JOURNEY - 0:45-1:30]
**VISUAL:** Show old spreadsheets, receipts, chaotic notes

**SCRIPT:**
> "In the early days, I was doing what most people do:
> 
> Guessing prices. Copying competitors. Hoping for the best.
> 
> Then inflation hit. Supplier prices went up 20%, 30%, sometimes 50%.
> 
> And I had no idea which menu items were actually making money anymore.
> 
> So I built a spreadsheet. Then a better spreadsheet. Then a system.
> 
> And that system saved my business.
> 
> It showed me we were LOSING money on three of our most popular items.
> It helped me price new products with confidence.
> It let me train my team to think about costs, not just cooking.
> 
> That system became Plato."

**VISUAL:** Show Plato interface briefly on screen

> "And now I want to share it with you."

---

### [THE MISSION - 1:30-2:15]
**VISUAL:** Back to you, more personal framing

**SCRIPT:**
> "Look, I'm not a tech founder. I'm a baker who learned to code out of necessity.
> 
> I'm in the kitchen. I'm on the floor. I'm in the spreadsheets.
> 
> I built Plato because I needed it. And I'm sharing it because I know you need it too.
> 
> But this channel isn't just about software.
> 
> It's about the REAL journey of building a food business in 2025:
> 
> - The mistakes I've made (and how to avoid them)
> - The systems that actually work
> - The numbers you need to know
> - The creative stuff that keeps it fun
> 
> Because running a caf√© or bakery should be rewarding ‚Äî not just exhausting."

---

### [THE PROMISE - 2:15-2:45]
**VISUAL:** Montage of caf√© shots, team working, food being made

**SCRIPT:**
> "So here's what you'll get from this channel:
> 
> ‚úÖ **Honest business breakdowns** ‚Äî Real numbers from my caf√©s
> ‚úÖ **Recipe costing tutorials** ‚Äî Using Plato (and showing you how)
> ‚úÖ **Kitchen management tips** ‚Äî What works, what doesn't
> ‚úÖ **Growth strategies** ‚Äî How we went from one site to multiple
> ‚úÖ **Behind-the-scenes reality** ‚Äî The good, the bad, the burnt batches
> 
> No fluff. No BS. Just practical stuff from someone who's actually doing it."

---

### [CALL TO ACTION - 2:45-3:15]
**VISUAL:** You holding a coffee, warm smile

**Storytelling Structure:**
1. Hook (problem/curiosity)
2. Context (your experience)
3. Conflict (the challenge)
4. Resolution (the solution)
5. Call to Action (subscribe/try Plato)

**Thumbnail Formula:**
- Your face (emotion: surprised, excited, concerned)
- Bold text (3-5 words max)
- Bright colors (stand out in feed)
- High contrast (readable on mobile)

### Authenticity Tips

**Be Real:**
- Share failures, not just wins
- Show messy spreadsheets and chaotic mornings
- Admit when you don't know something
- Let your personality shine through

**Build Community:**
- Ask questions in videos ("Have you experienced this?")
