# Your Current Stripe Configuration Status

## ‚úÖ What You Have Configured

Based on your `.env.local` file, you currently have:

1. **‚úÖ Stripe API Keys**
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Set (test mode)
   - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Set (test mode)
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Set

2. **‚úÖ Basic Product Setup**
   - `STRIPE_PRO_PRODUCT_ID` - Set (Professional product)
   - `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID` - Set (Professional price)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Missing

Your code expects the **new naming convention** with separate monthly/annual prices. You're currently using the **old naming convention**.

### Missing Environment Variables:

**Professional Plan (need to add monthly/annual):**
- `STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_PRODUCT_ID` (you have `STRIPE_PRO_PRODUCT_ID` - might be same)
- `STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` (missing)
- `STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` (missing)

**Team Plan (completely missing):**
- `STRIPE_TEAM_PRODUCT_ID` (missing)
- `STRIPE_TEAM_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` (missing)
- `STRIPE_TEAM_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` (missing)

**Business Plan (completely missing):**
- `STRIPE_BUSINESS_PRODUCT_ID` (missing)
- `STRIPE_BUSINESS_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` (missing)
- `STRIPE_BUSINESS_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` (missing)

## üîß Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Update Your .env.local (Recommended)

Add these to your `.env.local` file. You can reuse your existing product/price IDs:

```bash
# Professional (reuse your existing IDs)
STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_PRODUCT_ID=<your existing STRIPE_PRO_PRODUCT_ID value>
STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=<your existing STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID value>
STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID=<create annual price in Stripe and add here>

# Team (create in Stripe Dashboard)
STRIPE_TEAM_PRODUCT_ID=prod_...
STRIPE_TEAM_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_...
STRIPE_TEAM_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID=price_...

# Business (create in Stripe Dashboard)
STRIPE_BUSINESS_PRODUCT_ID=prod_...
STRIPE_BUSINESS_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_...
STRIPE_BUSINESS_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID=price_...
```

### Option 2: Check Your Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
2. See what products/prices you already have
3. Create missing ones if needed
4. Copy the IDs to your `.env.local`

3. **Update .env.local:**
   - Add all the missing environment variables
   - Use the format shown above

4. **Verify Setup:**
