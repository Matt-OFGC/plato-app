# Recipe Page Redesign

A complete from-scratch rebuild of the recipe viewing page based on the design mockup.

## 🎯 Overview

This is a test implementation of a modernized recipe page with enhanced UX, built entirely from scratch using modular components.

- ✅ Ingredient checklist with persistent state
- ⏱️ Interactive cooking timers
- 🔢 Dynamic recipe scaling
- 💰 Real-time cost calculations
- 📝 Inline editing (Edit mode)
- 🔄 Drag-and-drop ingredient reordering (Edit mode)
- 🖨️ Print-friendly layout

### Design
- Clean, modern UI matching the mockup
- Responsive layout (mobile → desktop)

## 🚀 Usage

Visit `/test-recipe-redesign` to see the landing page with links to:
- Recipe view: `/test-recipe-redesign/old-skool-sponge`
- Print view: `/test-recipe-redesign/print/old-skool-sponge`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses existing hooks: `useServings`, `useIngredientChecklist`, `useCountdown`
- Local state for ingredients (edit mode), view mode, active step

### Utilities
- `scaleQuantity`: Recipe scaling calculations
- `formatQty`: Quantity formatting
- `calcTotalCost`: Cost calculations

### Data Source
- Mock data from `/lib/mocks/recipe.ts`
- Can be easily swapped for real API data

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: < 640px (single column, compact buttons)
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1024px (single column, full buttons)
- **Desktop**: > 1024px (two column layout with sidebar)

## 🎯 Design Goals Achieved

✅ Matches the provided Photoshop mockup
✅ All features from old page preserved
✅ Clean, maintainable component structure
✅ Fully responsive design
✅ Enhanced user experience
✅ Production-ready code quality

## 🔄 Next Steps

If testing is successful, these components can be:
1. Integrated into the main recipe page
2. Connected to real database/API
3. Enhanced with additional features
4. Deployed to production

## 📝 Notes

- Built using Next.js 14 App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Server + Client component architecture
