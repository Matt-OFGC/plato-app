```

## 📊 Testing Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **First Input Delay**: < 100ms

### Usability Metrics
- **Touch Target Size**: ≥ 44px
- **Text Readability**: No zoom required
- **Navigation Accessibility**: All items reachable
- **Content Visibility**: No horizontal scroll

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Horizontal Scrolling
**Solution**: Check for fixed widths, use `app-container` class

### Issue: Text Too Small on Mobile
**Solution**: Use responsive typography classes (`responsive-text-*`)

### Issue: Touch Targets Too Small
**Solution**: Ensure minimum 44px height/width for interactive elements

### Issue: Layout Breaking on iPad
**Solution**: Test grid layouts, use responsive-grid classes

### Issue: Forms Causing Zoom on iOS
**Solution**: Use `responsive-input` class (16px minimum font size)
