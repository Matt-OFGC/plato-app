# Additional Security Fixes - Second Audit

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ All Critical Issues Fixed

---

## üî¥ Critical Security Vulnerabilities Found & Fixed

### 1. **JWT_SECRET Weak Default Fallback**
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** `/src/lib/auth-simple.ts`  
**Issue:** JWT_SECRET had a fallback to "your-secret-key-change-in-production" if environment variable not set. This is a critical security flaw.

**Before:**
```typescript
const JWT_SECRET = new TextEncoder().encode(
  process.env.JWT_SECRET || "your-secret-key-change-in-production"
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// JWT_SECRET must be set in environment variables
if (!process.env.JWT_SECRET) {
  throw new Error("JWT_SECRET environment variable is required");
}
const JWT_SECRET = new TextEncoder().encode(process.env.JWT_SECRET);
```

**Impact:** Application will now fail to start if JWT_SECRET is not properly configured, preventing deployment with weak secrets.

---

### 2. **Session Cookie CSRF Protection Weakness**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `/src/lib/auth-simple.ts`  
**Issue:** Session cookies used `sameSite: "lax"` which provides weaker CSRF protection than `"strict"`.

**Fix:** Changed to `sameSite: "strict"` for stronger CSRF protection.

**Impact:** Session cookies now provide maximum CSRF protection. May require users to re-authenticate when navigating from external sites.

---

### 3. **Team Invitation Token Exposure**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `/api/team/invite/route.ts`  
**Issue:** API response included full invitation object with sensitive token and inviteUrl. These could be logged, cached, or intercepted.

**Before:**
```typescript
return NextResponse.json({ 
  success: true,
  invitation,      // Exposed full object with token
  inviteUrl,       // Exposed the secret invite URL
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
return NextResponse.json({ 
  success: true,
  invitation: {
    id: invitation.id,
    email: invitation.email,
    role: invitation.role,
    expiresAt: invitation.expiresAt,
  },
  // inviteUrl only sent via email, not in API response
});
```

**Impact:** Invitation tokens can no longer be leaked through API responses or logs.

---

### 4. **Public Business Profile Data Leak**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `/app/business/[slug]/page.tsx`  
**Issue:** Public business profiles exposed:
- ALL company recipes (up to 6)
- Complete ingredient lists with prices
- Recipe costing information (proprietary data)
- Team member email addresses

This is a massive data leak of proprietary business information!

**Fixes:**
1. **Removed pricing/ingredient data from public recipes**
2. **Removed team member email addresses**
3. **Limited recipe data to basic info only**

**Before:**
```typescript
const recipes = await prisma.recipe.findMany({
  where: { companyId: company.id },
  include: {
    items: {
      include: {
        ingredient: {
          select: {
            name: true,
            packPrice: true,    // ‚ùå Exposed pricing
            packQuantity: true, // ‚ùå Exposed costing
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});

// Team members with emails
user: {
  select: {
    name: true,
    email: true,  // ‚ùå Exposed emails
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const recipes = await prisma.recipe.findMany({
  where: { companyId: company.id },
  select: {
    id: true,
    name: true,
    description: true,
    yieldQuantity: true,
    yieldUnit: true,
    imageUrl: true,
    // ‚úÖ No pricing or ingredient data
  }
});

// Team members without emails
user: {
  select: {
    name: true,
    // ‚úÖ Email removed for privacy
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Proprietary recipe costing and team member emails are no longer publicly accessible.

---

### 5. **Missing Authorization on Company Update**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `/api/company/update/route.ts`  
**Issue:** Company update endpoint only checked if user had A company, not if they had permission to manage THAT company's settings.

**Fix:** Added proper permission check using `checkPermission()`.

**Before:**
```typescript
const { companyId } = await getCurrentUserAndCompany();
if (!companyId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "No company found" }, { status: 404 });
}
// ‚ùå No permission check - any company member could update settings
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { companyId, user } = await getCurrentUserAndCompany();
if (!companyId || !user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "No company found" }, { status: 404 });
}

// ‚úÖ Check if user has permission to manage settings
const canManage = await checkPermission(user.id, companyId, "manage:settings");
if (!canManage) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "No permission" }, { status: 403 });
}
```

**Impact:** Only users with proper permissions can now update company settings.

## üìä Security Impact Summary

### Before Second Audit
```
‚ùå JWT_SECRET could use weak default
‚ùå Session cookies had weaker CSRF protection
‚ùå Invitation tokens exposed in API responses
‚ùå Proprietary recipe pricing publicly accessible
‚ùå Team member emails publicly exposed
‚ùå Missing authorization on company update
```

### After Second Audit
```
‚úÖ JWT_SECRET must be properly configured
‚úÖ Session cookies use strict sameSite policy
‚úÖ Invitation tokens never exposed
‚úÖ Recipe pricing is private
‚úÖ Team member emails are private
‚úÖ Company updates properly authorized
```

---

## üéØ Additional Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add `isPublic` field to Recipe model** - Allow companies to explicitly mark recipes as public vs private
2. **Add consent for team member display** - Let team members opt-in to public profile display
3. **Add IP allowlisting for admin panel** - Restrict admin access to specific IPs
4. **Implement request signing** - Add HMAC signatures to sensitive API calls

### Medium Priority
5. **Add file type validation on upload** - Use magic numbers, not just extension
6. **Add invitation rate limiting** - Prevent invitation spam
7. **Add team member activity log** - Track who does what in the company
8. **Add password reset flow** - Currently missing

### Low Priority  
9. **Add email verification** - Verify user email addresses
10. **Add session device tracking** - Show users where they're logged in
11. **Add data export** - GDPR compliance feature

---

## üîê Environment Variables Update

Added to `.env.example`:

```bash
# REQUIRED - Application will not start without this
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32"
```

**Generate a secure secret:**
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test JWT_SECRET Requirement
```bash
# Remove JWT_SECRET from .env and try to start app
unset JWT_SECRET
npm run dev
# Should fail with: "JWT_SECRET environment variable is required"
```

### Test Permission Check
```bash
# Try to update company settings as a VIEWER
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/company/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session=viewer_token" \
  -d '{"name":"Hacked Name"}'
# Should return 403 Forbidden
```

### Test Public Profile Privacy
```bash
# Check public business profile
curl http://localhost:3000/business/some-company-slug
# Verify:
# - No recipe pricing/ingredients visible
# - No team member emails visible
# - Only name/description shown
```
